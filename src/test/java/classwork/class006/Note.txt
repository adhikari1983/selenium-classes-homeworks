implicit  is going to  wait until the web element is found.
(element is not present in the DOM at the time of the beginning)


explicit is going to wait until the web element becomes enabled.
(excepted condition has to match)


waits are not slow or fast , it's the webElement how they are behaving so
     if it behaves quickly it will be fast
     if it behaves slowly it will be slow


Yes -> implicit and explicit wait can be in the same script.....

     Implicit wait ---> global wait --> in the start after opening the browser
     Explicit wait ---> it is specific to an element --> before the operation to be performed on element

     So, they will not interfere with each other
