Implicit:
        is going to  wait until the web element is found.
(element is not present in the DOM at the time of the execution flow of the script)
-> we can add it after creating the driver instance
-> declare once after getting the url and available for all the elements throughout the application
 ADVANTAGES:
 - it is very easy to use & we can add it only once
 DISADVANTAGE:
 - static typing (if the time is taking more than hard coded time there is a chances of throwing an exception)



Explicit:
        is going to wait until the web element becomes enabled.
(element specific & excepted condition has to match)
 ADVANTAGES:
 - element specific, works based on the certain condition

 DISADVANTAGE:
 - we have to use explicit wait for multiple WebElements. so, we cannot use one explicit wait
   Multiple elements.


FluentWait:
         also similar to WebDriverWait with more flexibility in polling time and ignores exceptions


waits are not slow or fast , it's the webElement how they are behaving so
     if it behaves quickly it will be fast
     if it behaves slowly it will be slow

INTERVIEW QUESTION:
Yes -> implicit and explicit wait can be in the same script.....

     Implicit wait ---> global wait --> in the start after opening the browser
     Explicit wait ---> it is specific to an element --> before the operation to be performed on element

     So, they will not interfere with each other
